            0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

-   This project is all about applying python basics to implement an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
-   The project has one task which includes: 0. Rotate 2D Matrix - Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. - Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix): - Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place. - You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
