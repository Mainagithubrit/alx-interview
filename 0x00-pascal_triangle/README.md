            # 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

- In this project there is one task, To create a pascals triangle using a python function.
- Key learning points:
        - Lists and List Comprehensions
        - Functions
        - Loops
        - Conditional Statements
        - Recursion (Optional)
        - Arithmetic Operations
        - Indexing and Slicing
        - Memory Management
        - Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
        - Efficiency and Optimization
 # The Task

    0. Pascal's Triangle
- Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:
        - Returns an empty list if n <= 0
        - You can assume n will be always an integer

        # The Output Required

        [1]
        [1,1]
        [1,2,1]
        [1,3,3,1]
        [1,4,6,4,1]

 - In this project there is a main.py function use it o run the code.
