# 0x05. N Queens

-   This Project is to place N queens on a NxN chessboard so that non of them can attack each other. This means that:

1.  No two queens can be in the same row.
2.  No two queens can be in the same column.
3.  No two queens can be on the same diagonal.

Our job is to write a program that finds all the ways to place the queens safetly.
